# A minimal R Markdown example

A quote:

> Markdown is not LaTeX.


## Text

Write text pretty much as usual with _some_ exceptions.


## Code chunks

Use the following tags to create a chunk of R code to be executed.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1:5)
x
```

Use options to control output like hiding code.

```{r echo = FALSE}
plot(1:10)
```

## Inline code

You can insert code inline too. And you can call up objects that were created earlier in the document, just like in an R session. Here is the mean of the vector `x` `r mean(x)`. 

## Math

LaTeX like math notation is also possible.

$$
P(x) = \frac{1}{{\sigma \sqrt {2\pi } }}e^{- \left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 / 2\sigma^2 } 
$$
