## Data Viz Versus Graphics

<p style="align:left;color:#669999;background-color:#e0eaea;padding:2%;"><i>Data visualizations</i> are interactive graphics designed for the Web.</p>

<img src="assets/img/dataviz_model.png" width='400px' height='200px' />

* Unlike traditional static graphical displays, data visualizations are:
  - Built for the Web
  - Interactive
  - Dynamic

---

## Why Data Viz in R?

* Majority of R tools for data viz are basically a set of functions to write javascript (js) output

* Chances are, if you are looking at an interactive graphic on the Web, it's written in js using a library like d3

* But...<u>what if you don't know js?</u> or <u>you have to do a lot of analysis</u> to produce the output for your chart?

## Popular R Tools for Data Viz

* ggvis

* googleVis

* plotly

* rCharts

* htmlwidgets

## Overview

<img src="assets/img/comparison_table.png" />

---

## Demonstration

* It is easiest to understand the differences between the visualization tools by seeing them in action

* In what follows, I'll use R's built-in dataset <code>state.x77</code> to conduct several charting exercises

```{r}
data(state)
state.x77 <- as.data.frame(state.x77)
str(state.x77)
```

---

## Task 1. Distribution of State Illiteracy

How can we make this histogram interactive?

```{r message = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=6}
# Static plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(state.x77, aes(x = Illiteracy)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "#663399")
```

## Task 2. State Illiteracy Versus Income 

How can we make this scatterplot interactive?

```{r message = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=6}
# Static plot
ggplot(state.x77, aes(y = Illiteracy, x = Income)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, col = "#663399")   
```

---

## Task 4. Add Trendlines

How can we add fitted lines to the scatterplot?

```{r message = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=6}
ggplot(state.x77, aes(y = Illiteracy, x = Income)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, col = "#663399") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "#663399", fill = "#663399")
```

---

## Task 4. Group Points

How can we group on a third variable?

```{r message = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=6}
colors <- colorRampPalette(c("#663399","#669999"))(4)
state.x77$region <- state.region
ggplot(state.x77, aes(y = Illiteracy, x = Income, colour = region)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_colour_manual("Region", values = colors)
```

---

## Task 5. Add State as a Tooltip

Tooltips are a way to avoid cluttered labels. How are they created in visualizations?

```{r message = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=6}
state.x77$state <- rownames(state.x77)
ggplot(state.x77, aes(y = Illiteracy, x = Income)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, colour = colors[1]) +
  geom_text(aes(label = state)) 
```

---

## Task 6. Adding  Controls

Controls add interactivity that aren't possible with a static plot. How are controls added to visualizations?

```{r message = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=6}
ggplot(state.x77, aes(x = Illiteracy)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "#663399")
```

---

## Specialty Plots with htmlwidgets

* _Widgets_ are a way to add new types of HTML output to R markdown documents

* This can be useful for enabling R to interact with javascript libraries like <code>d3</code> or <code>leaflet</code>

* Existing widgets (dygraphs, networkD3, d3heatmap) are just R packages

* You can also create your own widgets with <code>htmlwidgets</code>

* Some examples can be found at [http://www.htmlwidgets.org/](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/)
